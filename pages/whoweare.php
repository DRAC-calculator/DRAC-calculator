<h2>Julie Durcan</h2>

<p><img src="<?php DRAC_URL ?>images/JD.jpg" alt="">Julie is a Supernumerary Teaching Fellow at St Johnâ€™s College, Oxford and researcher at the School of Geography and the Environment, University of Oxford. She is a Quaternary Scientist with interests in palaeoenvironmental change in dryland regions, geoarchaeological applications and the advancement of luminescence dating as a geochronological technique. Her current projects include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reconstructing Holocene palaeoenvironments in the Indian sub-continent</li>
<li>Reconciling dust flux and fluvial activity in the Namib Desert</li>
<li>Quantifying late Quaternary fluvial and aeolian activity in Central Australia</li>
<li>Optimising the luminescence signal from quartz for dating applications</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find Julie on her University of Oxford <a href="http://www.geog.ox.ac.uk/staff/jdurcan.html">webpage</a>. She can be contacted by email at julie.durcan@ouce.ox.ac.uk.</p>

<h2>Georgina King</h2>

<p><img src="<?php DRAC_URL ?>images/GK.jpg" alt="">Georgina is an SNF Senior Scientist in the Institute of Earth Surface Dynamics (IDyST) at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland. She has a background in Quaternary Science and is specifically interested in geochronology. Her current projects include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Developing optically stimulated luminescence dating as a low-temperature thermochronometer, working on samples from Namche Barwa, Tibet</li>
<li>Reconciling the tephro- and luminescence chronologies of the Palouse Loess, Washington State, USA</li>
<li>Understanding the interactions between volcanic activity and climatic changes in the Kamchatkan Central Depression</li>
</ul>

<h2>Geoff Duller</h2>

<p><img src="<?php DRAC_URL ?>images/GGD.jpg" alt="">Geoff is a Professor of Geography in the Department of Geography and Earth Sciences at the Aberystwyth University, Wales, UK. His research is focussed on the development and application of luminescence dating. His recent projects include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Chronology, Adaption and Environment of the Middle Palaeolithic in northern Africa</li>
<li>Luminescence dating on the surface of Mars</li>
<li>Re-evaluating the environmental controls of the Harappan Civilization collapse using OSL dating of river palaeochannel sediments</li>
